## Project Details
### Details
This project consists of the following scenario: A determined area is divided into 5x5 squares, for mapping. Into this map, Monitoring Units are going to be deployed, in order to scan the area searching for disturbances. Each disturbance is randomly set on those squares, and has a specific type (CO2, Temperature, Visual or Methane). On the other hand, each unit has specific attributes to fight those disturbances, based on their type, like: The way it moves, the sensors they have, and the tools they can use. The goal of this is having option to select how many and what units are going to be deployed, and check if they can solve or not all the disturbances.
